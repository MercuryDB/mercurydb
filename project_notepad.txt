Tried using LinkedList for table. about 3x slower than using hashset

Clustrix says something like:
If you plan to run ClustrixDB in production, make sure you have 3 hosts or more to build a cluster with at least:
48 to 64 GiB of memory
Dual 4 Core Xeon CPUs
RHEL v6.4 to v6.6 or CentOS v6.4 to v6.6

They offer a good testing framework for comparison
